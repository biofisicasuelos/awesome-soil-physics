A curated list of awesome tools for soil physics analysis (software, scripts, packages, databases, etc)

### Python

- [Phydrus](https://phydrus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Python implementation of the HYDRUS-1D unsaturated zone model. With Phydrus, a HYDRUS-1D model can be created, calibrated and visualized through Python scripts, making it easy to adjust the model and providing a 100% reproducible workflow of your modeling process.

- [AquaCrop-OSPy](https://pypi.org/project/aquacrop/). Soil-Crop-Water model based on AquaCrop-OS. AquaCrop-OSPy is a python implementation of the popular crop-water model AquaCrop, built from the AquaCrop-OS source code.

- [unsatfit](https://sekika.github.io/unsatfit/). unsatfit is a Python library for optimizing parameters of functions of soil hydraulic properties (water retention function and hydraulic conductivity function). 

- [discfit](https://pypi.org/project/discfit/). Discfit reads disc permeameter data in the field and calculates hydraulic parameters of the soil; saturated hydraulic conductivity and Gardner’s alpha constant.

- [periodicgw](https://pypi.org/project/periodicgw/). Python package for generating periodic hydraulic conductivity fields and groundwater flow fields

- [ETo](https://github.com/Evapotranspiration/ETo). The ETo package contains a class and associated functions to calculate reference evapotranspiration (ETo) using the UN-FAO 56 paper. Additional functions have been added to calculate historic ETo or potential evapotranspiration (PET) for comparison purposes.

- [pyfao56](https://github.com/ElsevierSoftwareX/SOFTX-D-23-00060). A Python implementation of the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach for crop water use estimation and irrigation scheduling. The pyfao56 Python package facilitates FAO-56 computations of daily soil water balance using the dual crop coefficient method to estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET).

### R 

- [SoilHyP: Soil Hydraulic Properties](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/SoilHyP/versions/0.1.6). Provides functions for soil water retention (SWC) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (Ku).

- [soilphysics](https://github.com/arsilva87/soilphysics). In this package you will find a series of functions for soil physics data analysis.

- [soiltexture](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/soiltexture/soiltexture.pdf). The Soil Texture Wizard is a set of R functions designed to produce texture triangles (also called texture plots, texture diagrams, texture ternary plots), classify and transform soil textures data.

- [ggtern](http://www.ggtern.com/). ggtern is a software package for the statistical computing language R. It is an extension to ggplot2 specifically for the plotting of ternary diagrams. Useful for soil textural plots.

- [Rdvark](https://github.com/jknappe/Rdvark). R script to compute saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) values from Aardvark permeameter data.

- [Ternary](https://ms609.github.io/Ternary/index.html). ‘Ternary’ is an R package that allows the creation of ternary plots (a.k.a. ternary graphs / simplex plots / Gibbs triangles / de Finetti diagrams) and Holdridge life zone diagrams using the familiar functions of the default ‘graphics’ package.

- [hydroGOF](https://github.com/hzambran/hydroGOF). hydroGOF is an R package that provides S3 functions implementing both statistical and graphical goodness-of-fit measures between observed and simulated values, mainly oriented to be used during the calibration, validation, and application of hydrological models. 

- [https://github.com/hzambran/hydroTSM](hydroTSM). hydroTSM provides S3 functions for management, analysis, interpolation and plotting of time series used in hydrology and related environmental sciences. In particular, this package is highly oriented to hydrological modelling tasks.

### Software

- [HYDRUS-1D](https://www.pc-progress.com/en/Default.aspx?hydrus). Windows application for simulating water, heat, and solute movement in one-, two- and three-dimensional variably saturated media.

- [WEPP](https://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/tool/watershed-erosion-prediction-project-wepp). The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP), is a physically-based soil erosion prediction technology.

- [AQUACROP](https://www.fao.org/aquacrop/en). AquaCrop is a crop growth model developed by FAO’s Land and Water Division to address food security and assess the effect of the environment and management on crop production. 

### Databases y datasets

- [Global maps of potential and climatic plant-available soil water](https://zenodo.org/record/7600632#.ZB3dV-yZOdY). Authors:  Gupta, Surya;  Lehmann, Peter;  Bickel, Samuel;  Bonetti, Sara;  Or, Dani. This repository contains four global maps at 1km resolution per 1m soil depth: matric potential at FC [m], water content at FC [m3/m3], potential plant-available soil water [mm], climatic plant-available soil water [mm]. 

- [GSHP: Global database of soil hydraulic properties](https://zenodo.org/record/6640246#.ZB3eSOyZOdY). Authors:  Gupta, Surya;  Papritz, Andreas;  Lehmann, Peter;  Hengl, Tomislav;  Bonetti, Sara;  Or, Dani. A total of 15,259 SWCCs from 2,702 sites are reported. In addition to SWCCs, other soil variables such as soil texture (12,233 measurements), bulk density (15,125 measurements), and soil organic carbon (2,255 measurements) are also listed in the database.

- [Global long term daily 1 km surface soil moisture dataset with physics informed machine learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02011-7).
