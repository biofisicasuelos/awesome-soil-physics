A curated list of awesome tools for soil physics analysis (software, scripts, packages, databases, etc)

### R packages

- [SoilHyP: Soil Hydraulic Properties](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/SoilHyP/versions/0.1.6). Provides functions for soil water retention (SWC) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (Ku).
- [soilphysics](https://github.com/arsilva87/soilphysics). In this package you will find a series of functions for soil physics data analysis.

### Software

- [HYDRUS](https://www.pc-progress.com/en/Default.aspx?hydrus). Windows application for simulating water, heat, and solute movement in one-, two- and three-dimensional variably saturated media.

- [WEPP](https://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/tool/watershed-erosion-prediction-project-wepp). The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP), is a physically-based soil erosion prediction technology.

## Databases y datasets

- [Global maps of potential and climatic plant-available soil water](https://zenodo.org/record/7600632#.ZB3dV-yZOdY). Authors:  Gupta, Surya;  Lehmann, Peter;  Bickel, Samuel;  Bonetti, Sara;  Or, Dani. This repository contains four global maps at 1km resolution per 1m soil depth: matric potential at FC [m], water content at FC [m3/m3], potential plant-available soil water [mm], climatic plant-available soil water [mm].
