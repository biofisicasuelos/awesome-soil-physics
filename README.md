A curated list of awesome tools for soil physics analysis (software, scripts, packages, databases, etc)

### Python codes

- [Phydrus](https://phydrus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Python implementation of the HYDRUS-1D unsaturated zone model. With Phydrus, a HYDRUS-1D model can be created, calibrated and visualized through Python scripts, making it easy to adjust the model and providing a 100% reproducible workflow of your modeling process.

### R packages

- [SoilHyP: Soil Hydraulic Properties](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/SoilHyP/versions/0.1.6). Provides functions for soil water retention (SWC) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (Ku).
- [soilphysics](https://github.com/arsilva87/soilphysics). In this package you will find a series of functions for soil physics data analysis.

### Software

- [HYDRUS](https://www.pc-progress.com/en/Default.aspx?hydrus). Windows application for simulating water, heat, and solute movement in one-, two- and three-dimensional variably saturated media.

- [WEPP](https://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/tool/watershed-erosion-prediction-project-wepp). The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP), is a physically-based soil erosion prediction technology.

## Databases y datasets

- [Global maps of potential and climatic plant-available soil water](https://zenodo.org/record/7600632#.ZB3dV-yZOdY). Authors:  Gupta, Surya;  Lehmann, Peter;  Bickel, Samuel;  Bonetti, Sara;  Or, Dani. This repository contains four global maps at 1km resolution per 1m soil depth: matric potential at FC [m], water content at FC [m3/m3], potential plant-available soil water [mm], climatic plant-available soil water [mm]. 

- [GSHP: Global database of soil hydraulic properties](https://zenodo.org/record/6640246#.ZB3eSOyZOdY). Authors:  Gupta, Surya;  Papritz, Andreas;  Lehmann, Peter;  Hengl, Tomislav;  Bonetti, Sara;  Or, Dani. A total of 15,259 SWCCs from 2,702 sites are reported. In addition to SWCCs, other soil variables such as soil texture (12,233 measurements), bulk density (15,125 measurements), and soil organic carbon (2,255 measurements) are also listed in the database.
